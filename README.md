# Technologies

# Instalation

This repo contains 2 projects (backend and frontend), and you need to install all dependencies from each one, so enter in each folder project and run:

```bash
# /simple-crud-typescript-node-react-mongo/backend
npm i

# /simple-crud-typescript-node-react-mongo/frontend
npm i
```

# Running

Remember, the backend uses MongoDB to store data, so you will need him installed and executing. After that, we just need to run the backend and frontend, and the React will open the application on your browser.

```bash
# /simple-crud-typescript-node-react-mongo/backend
npm run dev

# /simple-crud-typescript-node-react-mongo/frontend
npm start
```
